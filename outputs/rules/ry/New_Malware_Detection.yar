This YARA rule is built to detect specific behavioral traits indicative of malware, focusing on particular P/Invoke patterns like `VirtualAlloc` and `WriteProcessMemory`, which are not present in benign files and are common in the given malware samples. The placeholder `"SomeSpecificMalwareBehavior"` should be replaced by actual strings that signify unique behavior observed in the new malware sample if available.
